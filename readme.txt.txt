Announcing: The All New GreenExperience.net Green Widget!

So, chances are pretty good that if you’re reading this, you’re a fellow blogger. One thing that you may or may not be aware of is that by blogging on a regular basis, you’re actually helping the environment tremendously! 

You see, blogs started out (and many still remain this way) as a way for people to electronically jot down thoughts, opinions, rants, reviews, and anything else they had on their mind. Instead of writing it on paper, or submitting it to traditional newspapers, blogs (technically, “weblogs”) allow pretty much anyone in the world to put the same stuff in a digital format, which did two things:

1. Those thoughts, opinions, rants, etc…were now available for the world to see and comment on.
2. It saved tons and tons of paper directly and indirectly. 

By keeping notes, blog entries, and everything else in a digital format, the use of paper was cut back drastically, which is a movement you can definitely call “green”. 

Perhaps you’re a blogger who deeply cares about the environment and current events in the energy world, or maybe you blog about something else altogether. Whatever it is you enjoy, we all have a common goal, and that is to preserve the Earth as best as we can, and show off our efforts in the process!

If you want to show off to the world how many pounds of paper you’ve saved by writing online, then you need to quickly download our cool “green” widget that will show exactly that. Depending on how many posts and pages you have, the GreenExperience.net green widget will calculate (based on technical research) how many pounds of actual paper you’ve saved. Pretty cool, right? We think so. 

So without further delay, why don’t you head on over to (URL) and download the latest and greatest in green widgets. When you think about all the trees being saved, which offset carbon emissions, it’s a staggering number (considering that there are an estimated 70 million bloggers in this world of ours). 

Never knew you were a tree-hugger, huh?
